#Re-
A modular content-driven web browser. 

#Manifest:

**Re-** as a new web browser alters the new way of surfing and consuming the web. “Re-” empowers the user to embrace the content of the web pages as well as the design and way how content is shown. Re- is a modular platform within which users can decide what type of content of a webpage they see. This becomes true by creating and adding content modules to the browser. Therefore “Re-” becomes a super minimal browser which is faster, more reliable and more efficient in terms of data-consumption by cutting off all the noises from a webpage’s content.

#Main Features 

**modular-content**: Users can create/develop their own content modules. Re- has four modules by default: 'text', 'image',  'hyperlinks' and 'metadata' modules which user can add/active one or more of them.

**customisable-content**: The idea of the modular-content gives you the possibilities of redesigning/reframing the content of a web page with css/html, javascript. Hence this is user who can decide how for example google looks on their browser.

**faster**: Since Re- does not take the webpages for grant and does not render javascript and css resources of a webpage, it is much faster compair to other conventional browsers.

**open-source**: Re- is an open source project. you can clone the entire project repo on Github and of course any contribution will be welcome.
