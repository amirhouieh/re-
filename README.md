#Re-
A modular content-driven web browser. 

#Manifest:

**Re-** as a new web browser alters the new way of surfing and consuming the web. “Re-” empowers the user to embrace the content of the web pages as well as the design and way how content is shown. Re- is a modular platform within which users can decide what type of content of a webpage they see. This becomes true by creating and adding content modules to the browser. Therefore “Re-” becomes a super minimal browser which is faster, more reliable and more efficient in terms of data-consumption by cutting off all the noises from a webpage’s content.
